# Project 4 - Loops

1) Write a program that will ask the user to input a password. If the password entered is correct, the code should exit with a welcome message. Otherwise, it should ask the user to enter the password again up-to 3 times, after which, it should exit with an error message.
```shell
add your code to password.py
```

2) Write a program that will take a word input from user then prints out the word without it's vowels
```shell
add your code to vowels.py
```


3) Edit the file wordCount.py to create a program that will take a paragraph and stores it into a dictionary with the words from the paragraph as the keys and the number of instances of the word as the values
example:
input >>> "I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high"
output >>> {'I': 6, 'be': 6, 'flying': 6, 'high': 6, 'shawty': 3}
```shell
add your code to wordCount.py
```


4) Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Hint: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method
```shell
add your code to factor.py
```
